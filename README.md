- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification

## Implementation Requirements

### Smart Contract Development
- Solidity for Ethereum implementation
- Hyperledger Fabric for permissioned components
- Web3.js/ethers.js for frontend integration
- IPFS client libraries for distributed storage

### Security Considerations
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Oracle security for external data feeds
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with data protection regulations

### Integration Points
- Existing ERP and supply chain management systems
- IoT devices and sensors (temperature, humidity, chemical detection)
- Laboratory testing systems
- Certification body databases
- Retail point-of-sale systems
- E-commerce platforms
